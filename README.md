# COGS-118A-Final-Project
My final project for COGS 118A: Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms.


## Abstract
At the time of publication, "An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms" by
Caruana et al. represented a comprehensive study of the most common supervised learning algo-
rithms of the day examined on di erent problems and di erent performance criterias. This paper
seeks to replicate some of their  ndings and corroborate the validity of their results by testing a
subset of the algorithms and metrics used in the original paper.
