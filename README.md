# COGS-118A-Final-Project
My final project for COGS 118A: Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms.


## Abstract
At the time of publication, "An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms" by
Caruana et al. represented a comprehensive study of the most common supervised learning algorithms of the day examined on different problems and different performance criterias. This paper seeks to replicate some of their â€€ndings and corroborate the validity of their results by testing a subset of the algorithms and metrics used in the original paper.
